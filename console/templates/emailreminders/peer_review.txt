One of the assignments for IPE is to provide feedback to fellow participants on their engagement with the simulation part-way through the event.  

You will be providing feedback to two of the participants in your group:

    {{subject1}}
    {{subject2}}

Please take some time before the simulation begins to review their profile pages, in particular the goals they have articulated for their role.

At the end of the day on Friday, please fill out this Google Form to provide feedback on the two colleagues you have been assigned to observe.  

You will need to fill out the form twice, once for each colleague.  

The feedback you provide will be shared with your colleagues anonymously, but the instructional team is collecting all of the feedback to ensure that the assignment gets completed.
